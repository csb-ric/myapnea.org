  Our team has updated the MyApnea.Org surveys. They are now shorter, include
  some new questions, and will continue to be useful for future research.
  Whether you are updating your surveys or completing them for the first time,
  sharing information (on our secure platform) is incredibly valuable to the
  sleep apnea research community. When you complete the surveys you will receive
  a personal sleep report that you can print and share with your health care
  provider.
