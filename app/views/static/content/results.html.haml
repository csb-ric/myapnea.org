Of the people who took the first surveys, 72% were women, the median age was 42 years, 63% had Crohn's disease, 34% had ulcerative colitis and 3% had other IBD.

Fortunately, there are simple activities that can prevent these from occurring. In a survey of over 7000 patients with IBD, only about half had a bone density scan or took calcium or vitamin D supplements to promote bone health. Only 40% reported having a skin exam and 16% reported always wearing sunscreen to prevent skin cancer. Less than two thirds had an influenza (flu) vaccine. These results show that not enough patients are doing simple activities to prevent weak bones, infections and cancers that may be related to IBD.<br><a target="_blank" href="https://cgibd.med.unc.edu/portal_clone/ccfapartners_test/docs/CCFA%20Partners_Status%20of%20Prevention%20in%20Patients%20with%20Inflammatory%20Bowel%20Diseases%20within%20the%20CCFA%20Partners%20Cohort.pdf">Scientific Abstract</a> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://cgibd.med.unc.edu/portal_clone/ccfapartners_test/docs/Summary prevention 7.6.pdf">Summary</a><br><br></font></font></li><li><font color="#363636"><font color="#363636"><font color="#363636"><b>Medication Adherence in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases within the CCFA Partners Cohort</b> <i>Presentation Dates: Dec 1-3, 2011</i><br>In a survey of over 7000 patients with inflammatory bowel disease, or IBD, more than half of all patients got a low score on medication adherence questions, which means that most patients are not taking their IBD medications correctly all of the time.

Over 4000 patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis took a survey about the types of food they frequently eat. Patients said that fruits and non-leafy vegetables were most likely to make their symptoms better, but fruits and non-leafy vegetables were also the most likely to make their symptoms worse.

This effect was seen regardless of health status at the beginning of the study, including age and smoking status. These results show that exercise may protect against disease activity in IBD. One other explanation for this finding is that patients with very well controlled disease are better able to exercise. If these results are found in other studies, exercise could be recommended to improve disease symptoms in IBD. <br><a target="_blank" href="https://cgibd.med.unc.edu/ccfapartners/docs/20130518_Exercise%20and%20Future%20Flares.pdf">Scientific Abstract</a><br><br></font></font></font></font></li><li><font color="#363636"><font color="#363636"><font color="#363636"><font color="#363636"><b>Sleep disturbance and risk of relapse in Crohn's disease and Ulcerative Colitis.</b> <i>Presentation Date: May 19, 2013</i><br>People with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), like Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, tend to have poor quality of sleep. In this study of over 3000 people with IBD, those with more disease activity, depression, female gender, a history of smoking, or those currently taking corticosteroids or narcotics were more likely to have sleep disturbance. Of people with Crohn's disease who were in remission at the beginning of the study, those with sleep disturbance were twice as likely to have a flare in 6 months.

About 10% said that hormonal contraceptive agents improved their symptoms, but about 8% said that hormonal contraceptive agents made their symptoms worse. Among women who had reached menopause, an older age of IBD onset was associated with worse symptoms after menopause. This study shows that symptom severity is influenced during times of hormone changes in many women with IBD and that duration of IBD may play a role in hormonally mediated symptoms.<br><a target="_blank" href="https://cgibd.med.unc.edu/ccfapartners/docs/20130519_hormone.pdf">Scientific Abstract</a><br><br></font></font></font></font></li><li><font color="#363636"><font color="#363636"><font color="#363636"><font color="#363636"><b>Validation of an Internet-Based Cohort of Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (CCFA Partners).</b> <i>Presentation Date: May 21, 2013</i><br>CCFA Partners is an internet cohort of patients with self-reported inflammatory bowel disease, or IBD.

IBD patients are often told to avoid these medications. We looked at patients in CCFA Partners in who were in remission (with few to no symptoms) and asked about regular NSAID use. We then looked at whether they flared 6 months later. A total of 791 patients were included, of these, 40.6% reported ever using NSAIDS at baseline. Patients with Crohn's disease (CD) who regularly used NSAIDS (? 5 times/monthly) had a 65% increased risk of later flare. No effect of regular NSAID use was seen for ulcerative colitis (UC). Those with CD who used acetaminophen (Tylenol) also had a 72% increased risk of later flare. Lower doses of NSAIDs had no association with flare. Therefore, regular NSAID use or acetaminophen use may increase the risk of flare in CD, but not UC. This may be related to effects of the medications. It is also possible that those people with IBD who require pain medications at baseline may not be in as full a remission, which may increase the risk of later flare.<br><a target="_blank" href="https://cgibd.med.unc.edu/ccfapartners/docs/Role%20of%20Non-Steroidal%20Anti-inflammatory%20Drugs%20in%20Exacerbations%20of%20Inflammatory%20Bowel%20Disease.pdf">Scientific Abstract</a><br><br></font></font></font></font></li><li><font color="#363636"><font color="#363636"><font color="#363636"><font color="#363636"><b>Development of CCFA Partners Kids &amp; Teens: an Internet-Based Cohort of Pediatric IBD.</b> <i>Presentation Date: Dec 12-14, 2013</i><br>After the successful launch of CCFA Partners for adult patients with inflammatory bowel disease, the kids and teens component (CCFA Partners Kids &amp; Teens) started in 2013. In partnership with the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America (CCFA), children &lt;18 years of age were asked to join the internet-based study through email invitations and promotion on social media sites. After informed consent, the children and their parents completed surveys asking questions about their disease, their medications and other patient reported outcomes (such as quality of life, fatigue, sleep, peer relations, mood, etc). In the first month, 419 children joined. The average age was 13, with about 1/2 being female and about 3/4 having Crohn's disease (CD). Common medications used by patients with CD were biologics, thiopurines (6mp or azathioprine) or mesalamine-based medications (Pentasa, Lialda, Apriso, etc). The most common medication for patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) was mesalamine-based medications. Most of the CD patients were in remission and most UC patients had mild disease. Children who had active disease had more depression and anxiety. Following this group of children over time will help us to learn a great deal about living with IBD as a child, and will allow us to follow these children into adulthood to learn even more about the disease itself, the impact of medications, and how symptoms change over time.<br><a target="_blank" href="https://cgibd.med.unc.edu/ccfapartners/docs/Advances%20Abstract%20KTv4.pdf">Scientific Abstract</a><br><br></font></font></font></font></li><li><font color="#363636"><font color="#363636"><font color="#363636"><font color="#363636"><b>Perceptions of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases Patients on Biobanking in the CCFA Partners Cohort.</b> <i>Presentation Date: Dec 12-14, 2013</i><br>A biobank is a collection of samples from patients (including spit, stool or blood). Biobanks are very important for understanding risk factors for developing disease or for severity of disease. We wanted to understand more about why patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) would or would not participate in a biobank. We first did a series of interviews over the phone with patients who were participating in the CCFA Partners study. This helped us to understand the important concerns about biobanks and develop a survey for use in CCFA Partners. We then sent a survey to over 800 people with IBD in CCFA Partners. We did a total of 26 phone interviews. Patients doing the interviews told us that they had concerns about how samples would be collected/stored; who would be allowed access; whether these samples would be used for other things (not only research); and whether this would affect whether they could get life insurance. Most people were not that worried about using the blood for genetic studies. People thought that that biobanks were important for research, that they might lead to a cure; that by donating they would be helping others or family members with IBD; and hoped that they might personally benefit, although most understood that they likely would not. These themes aided in the development of a survey instrument to assess perceptions of biobanking. A total of 476 people initially finished the survey. Almost 40% said that they would 'definitely yes' donate samples, 56.0% would 'probably yes' donate, 5.1% 'probably no' and 0.7% 'definitely no'. There were no factors that made someone more likely to donate (reported donation rates were not different for Crohn's disease (CD) versus ulcerative colitis (UC), remission versus active disease, or education level. People were most willing to donate spit, followed by blood and lastly stool. Knowing these important thoughts on sample donation/biobanks will help researchers to develop consents for IBD biobanks and design educational materials on biobanks for IBD patients.<br><a target="_blank" href="https://cgibd.med.unc.edu/ccfapartners/docs/Perceptions%20of%20Patients%20with%20Inflammatory%20Bowel%20Diseases%20on%20Biobanking%20in%20the%20CCFA%20Partners%20Cohort.pdf">Scientific Abstract</a><br><br></font></font></font></font></li><li><font color="#363636"><font color="#363636"><font color="#363636"><font color="#363636"><b>Behavioral Strategies to Improve Cohort Retention within CCFA Partners.</b> <i>Presentation Date: Dec 12-14, 2013</i><br>Earlier studies have shown that people who participate in surveys (such as CCFA Partners) may respond better to survey requests if these have a time limit (such as telling participants that surveys need to be done in 72 hours). This is called "scarcity." Other ways to improve survey response include messages targeting: paying it forward (that what you are doing will help people in the future), guilt, altruism (helping others), and self-serving (helping yourself). Our goal was to see if scarcity or these messages improved response rates within CCFA Partners. The scarcity group received a 'warning' email informing them that they will be sent a survey link the next day, and that they will have 72 hours to complete the survey. The control group received no warning email. We also tested the four different messages described above and a "control" message that just informed patients that it was time for their survey. We sent emails to a total of 8697 people within CCFA Partners asking them to complete their follow-up surveys. Of these, 2965 started their follow up survey. There was no difference between those in the 'scarcity group' as compared to control group. Scarcity was, however, more effective in the &gt;50 age group. Of the messages, guilt resulted in a significantly higher response rate, while the other messages were no different than control. In summary, behavioral interventions applied to an internet-based IBD cohort have little benefit in improving response rates. Guilt had the strongest effect. The reasons that the other messages did not work may be that these interventions don't apply in an IBD population, that e-mail messages are not as effective, or that members of CCFA Partners are already very motivated to fill out surveys. <br><a target="_blank" href="https://cgibd.med.unc.edu/ccfapartners/docs/Behavioral%20Strategies%20to%20Improve%20Cohort%20Retention%20within%20CCFA%20Partners.pdf">Scientific Abstract</a><br><br></font></font></font></font></li><li><font color="#363636"><font color="#363636"><font color="#363636"><font color="#363636"><b>Prevalence of Gluten Free Diet and Symptom Improvement in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases in CCFA Partners Cohort:</b> <i>Presentation Date: Dec 12-14, 2013</i><br><a target="_blank" href="https://cgibd.med.unc.edu/ccfapartners/docs/Prevalence%20of%20Gluten%20Free%20Diet%20and%20Symptom%20Improvement%20in%20Patients%20with%20Inflammatory%20Bowel%20Diseases%20in%20CCFA%20Partners%20Cohort.pdf">Scientific Abstract</a><br><br></font></font></font></font></li></ul></div>
