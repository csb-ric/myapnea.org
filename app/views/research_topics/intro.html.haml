      The end goal is to take a top rated question (a question that has received many “endorsements”) and for researchers to develop a grant proposal or study investigation on those questions that currently lack data. Top rated questions that have already been well researched will be reviewed and presented in the Research Highlights section of MyApnea.Org.

      Let's get started with 10 research topics. Once you click 'Get Started', you'll see a series of ten research questions that have been submitted by our members. You can “Agree” for a question if you think it is an area that should be researched or you can “Disagree” for a question if you don’t think it is of significant importance. We encourage you to add a comment to help explain your vote.

      Once you're finished with these ten, we'll bring you to the full view, where you can see the most popular and most discussed topics, and get the chance to ask your own questions.
