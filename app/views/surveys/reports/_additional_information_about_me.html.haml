          A BMI between 18 and 25 puts you in the
          %span.f500.primary-orange 'normal weight'
          category. Research has shown that people in this category are the least likely to develop severe obstructive sleep apnea, and more typically have mild or moderate OSA.
      - elsif bmi < 35
        %p.lead
          A BMI between 25 and 35 puts you in the
          %span.f500.primary-orange 'overweight'
          category. Research has shown that people who are overweight are more likely to develop moderate or severe obstructive sleep apnea.
      - elsif bmi < 100
        %p.lead
          A BMI above 35 puts you in the
          %span.f500.primary-orange 'obese'
          category. Research has shown that people who are obese are most likely to develop severe obstructive sleep apnea.
