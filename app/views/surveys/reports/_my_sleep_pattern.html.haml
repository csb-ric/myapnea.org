      Normal scores are less than 10. Scores of 11 or more indicate sleepiness, with scores greater than 16 indicating high levels of sleepiness.  Sleepiness may occur because of untreated sleep apnea, inadequately treated sleep apnea, not getting enough sleep per night (most adults need 7 to 8 hours of sleep per night), or another sleep disorder. Increased sleepiness may interfere with your ability to concentrate or stay alert during the day.

      If your score is greater than 10, you may want to talk to your health care provider as well as review your sleep habits to make sure you are getting 7 to 8 hours of sleep per night.
