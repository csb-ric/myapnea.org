        MyApnea.Org is part of a growing national network of patients, health care providers and researchers. This partnership is built upon the open exchange of information about sleep apnea.

      %p.lead MyApnea.Org is part of a growing national network of patients, health care providers and researchers. This partnership is built upon the open exchange of information about sleep apnea. Here we provide a series of questions to help the sleep apnea community better understand the symptoms found in patients with sleep apnea or at risk for sleep apnea, their experiences with getting diagnosed, and their health conditions. Many of you will have answered some of these questions before but it is important for us to ask them again so that we have an understanding of the MyApnea community now and over time. After you complete each survey, you will see how your answers compare to the others within the network.
