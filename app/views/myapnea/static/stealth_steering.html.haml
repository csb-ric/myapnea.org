              Adam Amdur is the chief operating officer and immediate past-chair of the American Sleep Apnea Association, the nation’s leading patient-led organization dedicated to reducing injury and disability from sleep apnea and to enhancing the well-being of those affected by this common disorder. Adam was diagnosed with severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in 2008. As he struggled to manage his OSA, it wasn't until he found his way to the sleep center at Stanford University that he received the support to adequately control his overall medical condition. Since then, Adam has been passionate about assisting others in understanding this disease and in getting the help they need. He is currently writing a memoir,
              %span.f400 Asleep at the Wheel, Living with Sleep Apnea,
              in the hope of educating the public about apnea and its effects on adults and children.
