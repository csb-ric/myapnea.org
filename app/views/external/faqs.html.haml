        What is MyApnea.Org?
      .brand-content
        %p
          MyApnea.Org is a network created by people with sleep apnea to empower
          others like us to get the answers we want and need through sharing and
          promoting research. MyApnea.Org offers sleep apnea patients and
          caregivers the opportunity to
          = link_to 'LEARN', learn_path
          more about apnea and effective treatments,
          = link_to 'SHARE', topics_path
          experiences with other members of the community, and contribute to
          = link_to 'RESEARCH', surveys_path
          to improve diagnosis, management, and treatments for sleep apnea.
        %p
          MyApnea.Org is what's called patient-powered research. You and others
          within the sleep apnea community can share health information, discuss
          experiences regarding treatment, and express views directly to
          researchers and sleep experts on future research projects that can
          make a difference. In return, you will get easy-to-use tools to track
          your health and learn from others about treatments, symptoms, and
          coping with sleep apnea to take control of your life.

      .brand-subtitle
        How is MyApnea.Org organized?
      .brand-content
        %p
          There are three main sections of MyApnea.Org. One section has
          information and resources about sleep apnea to help you
          = link_to 'LEARN', learn_path
          more about the disorder and how best to manage symptoms. Another
          section offers different ways for you to connect and
          = link_to 'SHARE', topics_path
          with others within the MyApnea.Org community. The third section is a
          = link_to 'RESEARCH', surveys_path
          portal, which allows consenting members to participate in research
          with the aim of improving sleep apnea care and treatments. To
          accomplish this research, you will be asked to take easy-to-complete
          surveys and to join other study activities. As we post new surveys,
          we'll invite you to complete them, too. You'll also receive special
          invitations (at least twice per year) to participate in other parts of
          the study. We will only ask for your participation in such a study
          after you've consented to that specific study. You will see all of
          your study activities and special invitations on your "dashboard"
          once you join the study.

        %p
          The goal of MyApnea.Org is to actively engage thousands of people with
          sleep apnea to share health information needed for research to improve
          the health and wellbeing of people with apnea. To collect your
          information, we need your permission, which you give by signing the
          consent form.

        What are the surveys about?
      .brand-content
        %p
          If you agree to participate in the MyApnea.Org research portal, you
          will be asked to complete a series of surveys about your sleep,
          symptoms, and health. The surveys will ask about things such as when
          you were diagnosed with sleep apnea, treatments you have used, medical
          illnesses such as high blood pressure, and your energy level. The
          basic survey will take less than 30 minutes to complete for most
          people. Some additional surveys may ask for sensitive information such
          as next of kin or detailed contact information. The surveys will help
          us learn how to best treat and manage sleep apnea. They will also help
          us learn what is most important to you about your treatment and
          disease management. You can do each survey online or on your
          smartphone whenever convenient for you.

      .brand-subtitle
        How often do I take these surveys?
      .brand-content
        %p
          You will be asked to update information on these surveys every 2 to 6
          months, or as your health changes. You'll also receive occasional
          special invitations to participate in other studies or take special
          surveys, depending on your specific health status. The surveys will
          usually give you an estimate of how long it'll take to complete them,
          so you can choose to take them when most convenient for you.
