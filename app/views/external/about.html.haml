      MyApnea is all about improving sleep apnea through information, support,
      and research.

    %p
      Join a patient-led community created to fight sleep apnea. MyApnea is a
      network created by people with sleep apnea to empower others and to help
      get needed answers.

    %p
      We are inviting thousands of people with sleep apnea and their caregivers
      to come together at MyApnea to learn more about symptoms and treatment, to
      share their experiences with others within the community, and to become
      part of an international research network to improve lives. It's a whole
      new way of finding helpâ€”for you and for millions of people with sleep
      apnea.

    %p
      MyApnea is a patient-powered research community. Together, members share
      health information, discuss experiences regarding treatment, and express
      views directly to researchers and sleep experts on future research
      projects that can make a difference. In return, you will get easy-to-use
      tools to track your health and will be able to learn from others about
      treatments, symptoms, and coping with sleep apnea to take control of your
      life. And we will report back on all interesting research findings, in
      language you don't have to be a scientist to understand.
