Dear <%= @user.first_name %>,

Thank you for registering as a Provider with <%= "#{ENV['website_name']}!" %>
We are excited that you have joined our dynamic patient-centered community and
we look forward to collaborating with you.

There are several ways that you can now let your patients know about <%= ENV['website_name'] %>.

VIA EMAIL

  - The method that has been most effective is a direct email to your patient
    panel either through your own account or through your organization's EHR or
    email system. Here is an example of an invitation email to your patients:

    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Your health data has power. If you haven't already, please join me and
      register for the sleep apnea patient-powered network <%= ENV['website_name'] %>
      through my unique portal at:

      <%= "#{ENV['website_url']}/p/#{@user.slug}" %>

      If you have already joined, thank you! Now you can link to my portal by
      visiting the link above and clicking on the button at the bottom of the
      page that says:

      "Yes, list <%= @user.provider_name %> as my Provider!"

      Together we have the power to help improve the lives of sleep apnea
      patients. Join now!
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

VIA WEB LINKS

  - You can also request electronic graphic links/buttons for placement on your
    website by sending an email to us at <%= 'support@myapnea.org' %>.

    We can tag the button so we can report to you how many people have used the
    link to come to the site. You can also just provide a link with the
    statement: "Join the sleep apnea patient-powered movement now" if space is
    more limited.

VIA PROMO CARDS

  - You can also download print materials about <%= ENV['website_name'] %>
    for use in your clinic or lab. You can find postcard or
    flyer sized promotional materials in English and/or Spanish here:

    <%= "#{ENV['website_url']}/marketing" %>

Thank you and welcome to <%= "#{ENV['website_name']}!" %>
