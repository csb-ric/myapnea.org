      "It seems as if research is generally driven by funding organizations, which oftentimes is not reflective of the needs of patients. By having large amounts of data provided by and for us, we can now drive the research agenda. This is a way to democratize researchâ€”to generate understanding on the part of the researchers and patients together."
