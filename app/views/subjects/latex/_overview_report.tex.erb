<% @insomnia_scale = @subject.report_insomnia(@data) %>
\begin{Large}\textbf{Insomnia Scale}\end{Large} (WHI Insomnia Rating Scale) \hfill
<% if @insomnia_scale %>\begin{Large}\textbf{<%= latex_safe @insomnia_scale %>}\end{Large}<% else %>\textit{Complete surveys at MyApnea.Org to get your score.}<% end %> \\

This scale measures symptoms of poor sleep quality. \\
Scores greater than 10 suggest problems with insomnia. If you score more than 10, you may want to talk to your doctor about your sleep quality. \\ \\


<% @fosq = @subject.report_fosq(@data) %>
\begin{Large}\textbf{Impact of Sleep on Daily Activities}\end{Large} (FOSQ-10) \hfill
<% if @fosq %>\begin{Large}\textbf{<%= latex_safe @fosq %>}\end{Large}<% else %>\textit{Complete surveys at MyApnea.Org to get your score.}<% end %> \\

This scale measures problems in every day functioning associated with sleep problems. \\
The score range is 5-20 points. A higher score means you have a better functional status. You can follow your score over time- if it increases, this suggests improvement. \\ \\


<% @sleepiness_scale = @subject.report_ess(@data) %>
\begin{Large}\textbf{Sleepiness Scale}\end{Large} (Epworth sleepiness scale) \hfill
<% if @sleepiness_scale %>\begin{Large}\textbf{<%= latex_safe @sleepiness_scale %>}\end{Large}<% else %>\textit{Complete surveys at MyApnea.Org to get your score.}<% end %> \\

The scale measures how sleepy you are during the day. \\
Scores higher than 10, suggest excessive sleepiness. This could be due to not getting enough sleep at night or poor quality of sleep due to a sleep disorder. If you score high, talk to your doctor about your sleep and sleepiness. \\ \\


<% @well_being = @subject.report_well_being(@data) %>
\begin{Large}\textbf{Well-Being Index}\end{Large} (World Health Organization) \hfill
<% if @well_being %>\begin{Large}\textbf{<%= latex_safe @well_being %>}\end{Large}<% else %>\textit{Complete surveys at MyApnea.Org to get your score.}<% end %> \\

This scale measures recent feelings of mood and well-being. \\
Scores vary from 0-100. A score lower than 50 (or if you answered 0 or 1 on any question) suggests symptoms of depression, which you should talk to your doctor about. \\ \\


<% @bmi = @subject.report_bmi(@data) %>
\begin{Large}\textbf{BMI}\end{Large} (Body mass index) \hfill
<% if @bmi %>\begin{Large}\textbf{<%= latex_safe format("%0.1f", @bmi) %>}\end{Large}<% else %>\textit{Complete surveys at MyApnea.Org to get your score.}<% end %> \\

BMI is calculated based on your height and weight. \\
A BMI over 25 puts you in the 'overweight' category. Research has shown that people in this category are more likely to develop severe obstructive sleep apnea. \\ \\
