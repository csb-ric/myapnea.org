      MyApnea.Org is what's called
      %span.lighter-blue patient-powered research.
      We're creating a platform that allows people with sleep apnea to have a direct impact on research priorities, in order to give them faster improvements in treatment methods. Input from people with sleep apnea is crucial to seeing how we can care for them better. By giving your provider page to your patients, you're joining an important movement to stop this disorder.
