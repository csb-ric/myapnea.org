# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).

# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)


## To re-create and re-seed database (including test fixtures)
# bundle exec rake db:drop; bundle exec rake db:create; bundle exec rake db:migrate; bundle exec rake db:fixtures:load RAILS_ENV=development; bundle exec rake db:seed;
