    Does educating sleep apnea patients about how to monitor and manage their treatment, including how to use and adjust their PAP machines, affect sleep apnea treatment outcomes (AHI, subjective reporting of symptoms, and compliance rates)?
  description: I am a sleep apnea patient with a professional research background in health-related behavior.  I was lead investigator in two state-funded research projects examining cancer screening and early detection behaviors among adults.  I know that the behavioral health research literature shows that a sense of personal responsibility, agency, and knowledge is associated with healthier behavior choices and more successful treatment outcomes in general.  It is reasonable to hypothesize that the same is true in the case of sleep apnea treatment. Currently sleep apnea patients are not taught how to monitor their PAP therapy with available software and how to appropriately make adjustments to their machine settings as conditions (e.g. age, weight, environmental variables) change, in partnership with their physicians.  Considering how poor overall PAP therapy compliance rates are, it is appropriate to consider that patients who quit therapy early (or who experience no improvement despite compliance) may do so because they have received no education or support for learning how to responsibly manage their treatment.  Internet patient support forums are overpopulated with SA patients struggling with adjustment to PAP treatment and who have no idea how to investigate what is happening with their treatment or how to correct it.  Without a sense of personal agency and an understanding of how to fine-tune pressure settings and comfort options after the initial titration, many patients discontinue treatment even before the first follow-up appointment after treatment commences.  To ignore the role of patient self-management in the treatment of sleep apnea is to hold back progress in sleep apnea research.

    What are the negative side effects of using a CPAP mask?
  description: I think that patients should be informed of CPAP side effects just like is done for medicines. My dentist scolded me because of predecessors of serious dental problems that occurred right after starting CPAP from dry mouth.  I had never had them before.  They stopped after I started brushing and flossing just before CPAP use and using Biotene mouthwash after brushing. I have had several parotid gland infections (one very serious) from dry mouth since using CPAP (never before).  I have tried to modify my mask to keep my cheeks from blowing out during sleep, but with only some success. I had a hearing problem (for the first time), hearing problems (possibly linked to CPAP).  I did not ask the doctor because the link had not occurred to me at the time of treatment.I have spent hours and hours of sleeplessness due to mask leaks.  Frequently, I am awakened from sleep by mask leaks.  My wife also wakes me to adjust my mask because she cannot sleep due to the noise (even though I could).

    How does the home environment (such as sleeping space comfort and features, neighborhood noise, young children) impact people's ability to use and benefit from CPAP?
  description: Understanding if and how certain aspects of home life impact CPAP use will be useful to sleep providers and OSA patients. This may enable providers to better troubleshoot or anticipate problems and help find solutions in the home to enhance CPAP use and experience.
