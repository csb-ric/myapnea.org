      What are the barriers to treating patients with mixed/central apnea?
    description: Obstructive sleep apnea is manageable and great results can be achieved from CPAP and other treatments. It is frustrating for patients with mixed/central apnea to learn that there are no answers and no success stories to provide some encouragement along the way. What is preventing similar success rates for those with mixed/central apnea?

      Is sleep apnea hereditary?
    description: Identifying common genes or morphologic structures among sleep apnea patients would be helpful in designing new treatments.  A first step towards identifying new therapeutic targets would be to see if there are genetic links among sleep apnea patients.

      Does treatment of sleep apnea with CPAP help improve heart rhythm issues (such as premature ventricular/atrial contractions, atrial fibrillations)?
    description: I have terrible heart electrical problems, take several medications and also recently got diagnosed with sleep apnea. Sleep apnea is common in patients with heart disease, but rarely recognized or treated. Will treatment of sleep apnea help improve heart issues?

      Does tongue size reduction reduce obstructive sleep apnea? By how much?
    description: Recent studies show those with larger fat deposits in the tongue have more obstructive sleep apnea symptoms than those who do not. If this is true, targeted therapy (diet, exercise of the area or surgery) may be an answer to resolving issues and therefore overcoming and reducing OSA. It's unclear how effective reduction can be.

      Does medical marijuana help or hurt obstructive sleep apnea?
    description:  I am willing to try anything to help both my wife and I get a goodnight’s sleep. I have heard mixed evidence as to whether or not medical marijuana will help our sleep apnea. A proper study should be done to determine the potential benefits and/or risks.

      Does treatment of sleep apnea with medication reduce hemoglobin A1c for diabetics?
    description: I have been on VPAP machines for 16 years and have been a type II diabetic over that period. I am still a diabetic, but under control. When I was placed on medications to address sleep issues, I experienced a decrease in my hemoglobin A1c. Is there a connection?

      Does educating sleep apnea patients about how to monitor and manage their treatment, including how to use and adjust their PAP machines, affect sleep apnea treatment outcomes (AHI, subjective reporting of symptoms, and compliance rates)?
    description: I am a sleep apnea patient with a professional research background in health-related behavior.  I know that the behavioral health research literature shows that a sense of personal responsibility, agency, and knowledge is associated with healthier behavior choices and more successful treatment outcomes in general.  It is reasonable to hypothesize that the same is true in the case of sleep apnea treatment. Currently sleep apnea patients are not taught how to monitor their PAP therapy with available software and how to appropriately make adjustments to their machine settings as conditions (e.g. age, weight, environmental variables) change, in partnership with their physicians.  Considering how poor overall PAP therapy compliance rates are, it is appropriate to consider that patients who quit therapy early (or who experience no improvement despite compliance) may do so because they have received no education or support for learning how to responsibly manage their treatment. Without a sense of personal agency and an understanding of how to fine-tune pressure settings and comfort options after the initial titration, many patients discontinue treatment even before the first follow-up appointment after treatment commences.  To ignore the role of patient self-management in the treatment of sleep apnea is to hold back progress in sleep apnea research.

      How does the home environment (such as sleeping space comfort and features, neighborhood noise, young children) impact people's ability to use and benefit from CPAP?
    description: Understanding if and how certain aspects of home life impact CPAP use will be useful to sleep providers and OSA patients. This may enable providers to better troubleshoot or anticipate problems and help find solutions in the home to enhance CPAP use and experience.

      Does treatment of OSA with dental appliances reduce risk for drowsy driving?
    description: While there is information that connects CPAP use to reduced drowsy driving, there is little on the use of dental devices. This is an especially important topic for truck drivers who don’t always have easy access to their CPAP devices.
