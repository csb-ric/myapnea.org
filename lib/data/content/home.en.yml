      Join a new patient-led community created to fight sleep apnea. MyApnea.Org is a network created by people with sleep apnea to empower others and to help get needed answers.

      We are inviting thousands of people with sleep apnea and their caregivers to come together at MyApnea.Org to learn more about symptoms and treatment, to share their experiences with others within the community, and to become part of a national research network to improve lives. It’s a whole new way of finding help—for you and for millions of people with sleep apnea.

      MyApnea.Org is what’s called patient-powered research. Together, members share health information, discuss experiences regarding treatment, and express views directly to researchers and sleep experts on future research projects that can make a difference. In return, you will get easy-to-use tools to track your health and will be able to learn from others about treatments, symptoms, and coping with sleep apnea to take control of your life. And we will report back on all interesting research findings, in language you don’t have to be a scientist to understand.

          My wife told me I stopped breathing while I slept…a lot! She lost sleep thinking that I would die and our lives were severely impacted by it. Thankfully, she read an article on sleep apnea and made me go to the doctor. I don’t want other people to suffer needlessly from this condition.

          My husband suffered for 25 years with sleep apnea before being diagnosed. It affected his life and career. We are convinced that his father died as a result of having it. And our daughter was also diagnosed at the age of 3. I want other parents to realize that sleep apnea can run in families and kids suffer from this condition, too.

          I have always snored, loudly. I had no idea it was more than just a nuisance to my wife and family. My son had been trying to be me to see a doctor for years, but it wasn’t until he asked me one Christmas if I planned on seeing his children grow up that I took it seriously. I have lowered my blood pressure and my chances of heart disease by getting treated and even take my CPAP with me on overnight motorcycle trips. I want to be a part of this network and help research new treatment options.
