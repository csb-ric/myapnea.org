      title: What is MyApnea.Org?
      content: |
        MyApnea.Org is a network created by people with sleep apnea to empower others like you and us get the answers WE want and need through what’s called patient-powered research.  We are funded by the Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute (Link to PCORnet), which was created by the federal government.  You and others like us share health information, discuss experiences regarding treatment, and express views on future research projects directly with researchers and sleep experts that can make a difference.  In return, you will get easy to use tools to track your health and learn from others about treatments, symptoms, and coping with sleep apnea in order to take control of your life.

        Information collected from you will be combined with information from others in the network to describe the health outcomes being studied.  Other patients and researchers will be able to view graphs and summary information on groups of patients.  When combining this information, your name and other personal information WILL NEVER be used.  You always decide how you want to share your personal information.

        Initially, MyApnea.Org will collect information about you and your health via a series of quick and easy surveys.  As we collect this information, we will be building powerful tools and apps to share this information back with you.

        Ultimately MyApnea.Org will:

        - Connect you to thousands of other members to share information and advice about living with sleep apnea.
        - Provide a secure and dynamic dashboard of sleep, health and risk measures based on the personal health data you submit by survey and by positive airway pressure (PAP) machines and other health monitoring devices.
        - Support you with “how-to” information and other educational resources.
        - Present the latest in sleep health news and research findings.
        - Give you a voice in what health outcomes are important to you.

      title: What is the Sleep Apnea Patient Centered Outcome Network?
      content: |
        The Sleep Apnea Patient Centered Outcomes Network (SAPCON) is the formal network name for MyApnea.Org.  It is coordinated by the American Sleep Apnea Association and the Division of Sleep and Circadian Disorders at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Harvard Medical School, under the guidance of principal investigator Susan Redline, M.D., M.P.H. The MyApnea.Org network is part of a historic national research endeavor that will ultimately enlist one hundred million people to provide personal health data and to guide the course of comparative effectiveness research for multiple, serious and chronic diseases.  Funded by the Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI), MyApnea.Org/SAPCON is one of 18 Patient Powered Research Networks (PPRN) that will comprise a national “network of networks” dedicated to conducting comparative effectiveness research.  It is an unprecedented effort that will redefine how health research is done in this country and it holds tremendous promise for people who suffer from these conditions each day.

As he struggled to manage his OSA, it wasn't until he found his way to the sleep center at Stanford University that he received the support to adequately control his overall medical condition. Since then, Adam has been passionate about assisting others in understanding this disease and in getting the help they need. He is currently writing a memoir, Asleep at the Wheel with Sleep Apnea, in the hope of educating the public about apnea and its effects on adults and children.

    funder_description: |
      The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) is an independent, non-profit organization authorized by Congress in 2010 to fund research aimed at improving the health of entire populations.

      In December 2013, the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute approved $93.5 million to support 29 clinical research data networks that together will form an ambitious new resource known as PCORnet, or the National Patient-Centered Outcomes Clinical Research Network. PCORnet will be a large, highly representative, national network for conducting clinical outcomes research. PCORnet will integrate data from 11 Clinical Data Research Networks—networks that originate in healthcare systems such as hospitals, health plans, and practice-based networks and securely collect real-time health information during the routine course of patient care—and 18 Patient-Powered Research Networks—networks operated and governed by groups of patients and their partners who are focused on a particular condition and interested in sharing health information and participating in research.
