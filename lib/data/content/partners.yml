- name: Shared Health Research Information Network
  description: |
    The Shared Health Research Information Network (SHRINE) helps researchers overcome one of the greatest problems in population-based research: compiling large groups of well-characterized patients. Eligible investigators may use the SHRINE web-based query tool to determine the aggregate total number of patients at participating hospitals who meet a given set of inclusion and exclusion criteria (currently demographics, diagnoses, medications, and selected laboratory values).
