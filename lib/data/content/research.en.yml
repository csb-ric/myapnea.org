      Initially, the research portal of MyApnea.Org will collect information from members via a series of surveys. As we collect this information, you will be able to see your health information in comparison to others within the community. Over time, we will be building powerful tools and apps to share with you. We will even ask you to help us identify the types of tools you want.
