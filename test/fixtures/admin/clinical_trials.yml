  title: Type 2 Diabetes and Obstructive Sleep Apnea
  overview: A study at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center
  description: Both obstructive sleep apnea and type 2 diabetes can lead to cardiovascular disease; however, few studies have looked at what happens to the heart and blood vessels in people with both conditions. Yet, despite optimal treatment of blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol, people with diabetes can still be at risk of cardiovascular disease. Additionally, sleep apnea is very common among people with diabetes, and so it is possible that the presence of untreated sleep apnea may contribute to these cardiovascular problems in people with diabetes. This study is designed to investigate whether treatment of sleep apnea in people with diabetes can improve cardiovascular health.
  eligibility: The study team is looking for people with type 2 diabetes aged 18-70, who are interested in having a home-based sleep study to see if they have sleep apnea. They cannot include anyone that has used a CPAP machine at home in the past, or anyone who has had a heart attack, stroke, or other serious cardiovascular illness. All study visits take place in Boston, MA.

  title: Support Groups for New CPAP Users
  overview: A study at Brigham and Women's Hospital
  description: Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the first-choice treatment for most people with obstructive sleep apnea. CPAP treats sleep apnea very well in most people, but it can be difficult to get used to wearing a machine and mask to bed each night. This study is looking at whether attending support group discussions led by successful CPAP users will help new CPAP users get the most out of their therapy.
  eligibility: The study team is looking for enthusiastic people who have been successfully using CPAP for at least two years, who would be interested in working with the research team to lead some support group discussions in Boston, MA. Candidates will need to interview, and training will be provided.
