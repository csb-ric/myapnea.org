  bio: Susan Redline is the Peter C. Farrell Professor of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School and Director of the Programs in Sleep and Cardiovascular Medicine and Sleep Medicine Epidemiology at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. She is a sleep medicine physician and has led many national research projects aiming to understand the causes and consequences of sleep apnea, as well as clinical trials addressing the role of sleep apnea interventions in improving health, cognition and behavior in children and adults. She believes that patient-centered research has promise to make research more responsive to patient needs, while improving the likelihood of generating data that makes a difference for patients, their families and health care systems.
